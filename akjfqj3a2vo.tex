For~\textit{homo sapine} DPP4, prolyl oligopeptidase family region is located towards the C-terminus of the protein chain and spans from amino acid 561 to amino acid 763. This region contains prolyl endo catalytic region (i.e. aa605-aa635) which has a serine catalytic triad, which consists of Ser630, Asp708, His740 and the active Serine site at Ser630. \par
This region is highly preserved through evolution and is suspected that the catalytic activity is essential to biological functions, therefore is selected under positive pressure.
