For~\texit{homo sapine} DPP4, prolyl oligopeptidase family region is located towards the C-terminus of the protein chain and spans from amino acid 559 to amino acid 765. This region contains serine catalytic triad, which consists of Ser630, Asp708, His740 and the active Serine site at Ser630. \par
This region is highly preserved through evolution and is suspected that the catalytic activity is essential to biological functions  therefore is selected under positive pressure.
