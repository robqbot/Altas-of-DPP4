\subsection{Glycosylated (aa49 - aa324) and Cysteine-rich Region (aa325 - aa552)}



\subsubsection{N-terminal region (aa108 - aa478)}

This domain defines DPP4 subfamily S9B, therefore is also referred as DPP IV N-terminal region. 

\subsubsection{ADA binding site}
Leu294 and Val341 have been demonstrated via mutagenesis to be critical for ADA binding.~\cite{Abbott_1999} Leu294 and Val341 are located on two short $\alpha$-helices (291-294, 341-343 respectively), those two $\alpha$-helices are suspected to play important role in ADA binding.
