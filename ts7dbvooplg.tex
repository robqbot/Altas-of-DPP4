\subsection{N-terminal region (aa108 - aa478)}

This domain defines DPP4 subfamily S9B, therefore is also referred as DPP IV N-terminal region. 

In terms of post-translational modifications, this region under heavy glycosylation, with up to 5 sites can be modified via N-Acetylglucosamine Asparagine (i.e. N-linked) at site 150, 219, 229, 281, 321.~\cite{Rasmussen2003,Thoma2003,Meng2010,Chen2009,Hiramatsu2003} In addition, phosphorylation has been detected~\textit{in vivo} at site 256, 439, 440 in human sample.~\cite{Hornbeck2015, Mertins2014} Also

\subsubsection{ADA binding site}
Leu294 and Val341 have been demonstrated via mutagenesis to be critical for ADA binding.~\cite{Abbott_1999} Leu294 and Val341 are located on two short $\alpha$-helices (291-294, 341-343 respectively), those two $\alpha$-helices are suspected to play important role in ADA binding.
