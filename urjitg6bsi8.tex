The human DPP4 IV gene span aproximately around 70 kb and is found on the long arm of chromosome 2 (2q24.3). The gene consists of 26 exons with each size varies from 45 b to 1.4 kb.~\cite{Abbott1994} The 5'-flanking region has missing both TATA box and CAAT box, but a G-C rich region spans 300 bp which is suspected to promote binding with number of transcription factors like NF$\kappa$B, AP2 and Sp1~\cite{Abbott1994,BÃ¶hm1995} The transcription of DPP4 IV
